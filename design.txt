128-bit nodes
32-bit type and reference, 64-bit data
for strings and arbitrary ints, there is a header node for reference counting with a pointer to the first and last element.
the string or int itself is composed of data nodes in a linked list. There are no reference counts, instead reference is a pointer to the next node or, in the case of the last element, the length in bytes( strings ) or nodes ( ints ).  This means strings are capped at 4GB.
